# Clustering Practices: Implementing-and-Validating-Clustering-Methods-on-Synthetic-and-Real-world-Data

## Dive into Clustering: Algorithms, Validation, and Exploration

This project delves into advanced clustering techniques used in Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Exploratory Data Analysis. You'll explore various clustering algorithms and assess their effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

**Key Activities:**

* **Clustering Implementation:** You'll apply K-means and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms to five different datasets (Dataset 1.csv - Dataset 5.csv).
* **Rigorous Validation:** The performance of each clustering algorithm will be rigorously evaluated using external validation metrics like ARI, NMI, and FMI.
* **Data Visualization:**  To gain deeper insights, data points in each dataset will be visualized in 2D or 3D space.

**Real-World Application:**

Moving from synthetic data, you'll then focus on a real-world dataset - "WorldIndicators.csv". This dataset holds valuable information on various countries.

* **Grouping by Similarity:** K-means and Hierarchical Clustering will be used to group countries with similar attributes.
* **Internal Validation:** To assess the quality of the formed clusters, internal validation metrics like the Silhouette score and Calinski-Harabasz index will be calculated.
* **Optimal Solution Identification:** Based on the validation results, the optimal clustering solution will be identified. 
* **Exploring Clusters:**  You'll delve into the characteristics of each cluster, providing insights into the grouped countries.
* **Visualization Power:** Scatter plots will be created to visually represent the clustering results, highlighting relationships between attributes (e.g., "Life expectancy vs GDP") and cluster membership.

**Technical Stack:**

* Platform: Jupyter Notebooks (Python)
* Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, scipy
